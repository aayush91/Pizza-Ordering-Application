This is a Restful Web based application created using Eclipse IDE. 
The steps to run this project are as follows:-
1. Deploy the project on a Server (I have used Tom Cat Server for demo purpose)
2. Update the Maven project (It syncs the Eclipse project settings with that of the pom.xml file)
3. Run the project on server in Eclipse.
4. The index.html page is displayed on the browser.
5. Once you enter order details in the form and place your order, your order will be saved in a file.
